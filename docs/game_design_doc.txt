	1.3. Summary: Caillen “Cal” Waters is burnt out—emotionally, mentally, and physically drained by the grind of a thankless job and a life that feels like it’s going nowhere. He’s ready to pack up and start over somewhere new, anywhere but here. | But the house he never left—shared with the daughter of his late landlord, her daughter, and their chaotic circle—has other plans. As Cal begins to reconnect with the people quietly orbiting his life, he discovers warmth, affection, and maybe even love in the most unexpected places. | Tied to Home is a feel-good, emotionally intimate adult visual novel about family-style bonding, unconventional romance, and the slow realization that sometimes, everything you need is already under your roof.
