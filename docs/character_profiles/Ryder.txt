Love Interest #3: Maxine “Ryder” Ryder
Age: 18
 Role: Bella’s best friend; firecracker of the trio
 Personality: Bold, mouthy, confident with peers — cold and annoyed with Cal
 Name Note: Hates “Maxine.” Refuses “Max.” Only answers to Ryder.

Traits:
Loud, competitive, fiercely loyal to Bella


Sees Cal as a pathetic older guy clinging to the past


Secretly unsettled by how much Bella and the ditz like him


Wears crop tops, flannel shirts, and boots — attitude in fashion form



Early Relationship:
Thinks Cal is a doormat and doesn’t hide her disdain.
 Calls him things like “Old man,” “Dead weight,” or “Ghost of this house.”
 Doesn’t understand why the girls dote on him — and kind of resents it.

First H-Scene:
During a punishment game at the house, Ryder loses


Dare: Take off her top and bra and kiss the MC at the same time


She marches up and plants a kiss on his mouth, playing it cool — but when she returns and the girls say, “You could’ve just kissed his cheek,” she goes red and bolts


That night, she feels different, but won’t talk about it



Emotional Growth:
As the group grows closer, Ryder keeps seeking Cal out… for more punishment games, accidents, stolen moments


Eventually, Cal (now more confident) calls her out gently:

 “You keep saying I’m nothing special… but your body doesn’t agree. So which one’s lying?”


That becomes a turning point for Ryder, who realizes she’s fallen for someone she swore she’d never respect

Sexual Relationship with Cal:
Style: Bratty submissive evolving into eager masochist


Control: Starts with playful resistance, but fully gives in when Cal asserts dominance


Tone: Teasing and combative up front; raw, intense, and deeply physical as the relationship develops


Behavior:


Constantly pushes Cal’s buttons with attitude and snark to provoke a reaction


Acts annoyed or unimpressed until he pins her, chokes her lightly, or makes her beg — then turns to jelly


Squirts easily from rough handling and overstimulation


Craves being punished — spanking, hair pulling, verbal degradation — especially when she acts out intentionally


Early Game: Light masochism emerges, mostly through spanking or light impact


Mid Game: She starts asking for harder treatment and gets turned on by restraint, humiliation, and rough sex


End Game: Fully embraces her masochism; needs Cal to be creative (e.g., toys, control games, dirty talk challenges)


Pregnancy Arc: Becomes frustrated that her physical limits change and Cal has to go easier on her — complains teasingly about how boring “gentle” is
