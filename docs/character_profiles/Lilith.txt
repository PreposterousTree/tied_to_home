Love Interest #1: Lilith “Lily” Stone
Age: 34
 Job(s):
Part-time convenience store clerk (late evenings)


Waitress at a local breakfast diner (early mornings)


Personality:
Stubborn, short-tempered, secretly soft


Perpetually exhausted but won’t admit it


Resents how much she cares, especially about Cal


Home Dynamic:
Supposed to “manage” the home but barely has time or energy


Her daughter does most of the actual cooking and cleaning


Still acts like the authority figure… badly



Relationship Spark:
One evening, Cal comes home from work and finds her outside, smoking.
 He stops at the front steps and says, “You know that’s going to kill you, right, Lily?”
 The name slips out like it always used to — soft, familiar.
 She freezes… then snaps at him before quickly going inside. But the look in her eyes lingers.
A few scenes later, she has too much wine and confesses she doesn’t hate being called Lily… just hates how it makes her feel

Early H-Scene:
After several awkward moments following the “Lily” incident, she drinks a little too much one night


Cal finds her curled on the couch, muttering about how he always worried her


She pulls him down into a kiss, trying to claim control — but the moment melts into something vulnerable


She regrets showing weakness afterward, but it’s too late: he saw through the armor

Sexual Relationship with Cal:
Style: Aggressive and dominant, especially at first.


Control: She often initiates and pushes Cal to react rather than lead.


Tone: Sex is emotionally charged — a mix of pent-up frustration, jealousy, and desire.


Behavior:


She takes control of the pace and positioning.


Uses sex to assert emotional dominance she can’t express verbally.


May act like she doesn’t care afterward, but lingers close.


Keywords:
Assertive, rougher pace, impulsive, emotionally messy, growly tsundere heat.
