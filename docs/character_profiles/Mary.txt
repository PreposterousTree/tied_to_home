Love Interest #7: Mary Bordeaux
Age: 54
 Role: Lilith’s godmother, neighbor to the household
 Personality: Flirtatious, worldly, charming — but quietly yearning
 Appearance: Stylish and elegant — always looks like she just stepped out of a boutique

Traits:
Uses flirtation like a second language


Enjoys embarrassing Cal in public with bold compliments


Genuinely enjoys teasing the younger girls about their “boyfriend”


Has spent many nights alone with wine and old photo albums — she hides it well



Relationship Start:
Cal is returning from work one day when Mary calls out to him from her porch
 “You’ve been looking too tense lately. Come over and let me spoil you a little, sweetheart.”
 He normally brushes off her flirtation, but today he hesitates… then agrees
 Mary’s heart jumps — she didn’t think he’d finally say yes — but she plays it smooth and leads him in

First H-Scene:
Her home smells like spiced wine and lavender


She pours him a drink, sits close, and lightly rests a hand on his thigh


When Cal finally kisses her, she doesn’t waste a second — but later, when he’s asleep, she watches him quietly and whispers, “Took you long enough…”



Sexual Relationship with Cal:
Style: Mature, sensual, and indulgently receptive — she wants to be handled, not worshipped or obeyed


Control: Willingly submits with calm confidence — not shy, not dominant, but entirely open to being taken


Tone: Luxurious and slow — she relishes every touch, every reaction, every moment of connection


Behavior:


Loves the age gap — gets turned on imagining Cal as a younger man, and being the older woman who finally gets her hands on him


Constantly references their age gap in sultry ways (“Still chasing after your Auntie, hmm?”)


Though untouched by others, she considers herself highly experienced mentally — enjoys pushing boundaries in refined, confident ways.


Gives Cal anal first — Has a strong preference for it and is a deliberate act of trust and submission


Early Game: Enjoys toy play and blindfolds — she lets Cal explore her, trusts his lead, and quietly revels in the attention


Mid Game: Develops a love for being tied down — wrists bound above her head, legs parted, exposed and trembling under Cal’s control


Gives him full access, not out of submission, but because she knows she’s earned the right to be loved this way


Speaks slowly and seductively during sex — guiding, praising, or mock-teasing
