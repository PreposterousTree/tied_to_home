 Living Situation: Still lives in the house where his late landlord (a surrogate father figure) raised him

Quick to apologize, especially when he feels like a burden


Tends to avoid conflict unless someone he cares about is hurt



Personality Snapshot
Caillen is the kind of man who blends into the background — until you need him. He’ll drive you to the ER at 2 AM, fix your broken faucet on his lunch break, or sit quietly while you vent about your day. He doesn’t ask for much, but his presence makes people feel grounded.
He thinks he’s forgettable. He’s wrong.

 Emotional Journey
Beginning: Just surviving, not really living. Burned out, running on caffeine and routine.


Middle: Starts noticing how the women in his life brighten his world — and how much they choose to be there for him.


Climax: Must learn to take responsibility for their feelings. To stop passively letting things happen and actively care for the people who love him.


Ending: A new kind of family. A warm, chosen life. Maybe tired eyes, but a full heart.
