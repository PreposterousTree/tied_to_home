Love Interest #2: Isabella “Bella” Stone
Age: 18
 Role: Lily’s daughter, unofficial “heart” of the household
 Personality: Kind, responsible, quietly mature
 Calling Quirk: Sometimes calls Cal “dummy” affectionately when he overworks himself

Personality Traits
Calm and grounded — the one who makes sure dinner gets made and laundry gets folded


More mature than her mother in practical ways


Has a quiet crush on Cal, but masks it with casual affection and subtle service


A bit of a romantic beneath the surface — she wants to be seen as a woman, not just a helpful kid



Household Role
Took over cooking and cleaning from a young age because her mom couldn’t handle it


Feels most useful when she’s helping others — especially Cal


Packs him lunch, nags him about hydration, scolds him for forgetting meals



Relationship Start
One night, Cal comes home late and finds Bella asleep at the kitchen table, waiting for him.
 She made him dinner, covered it with foil, and left him a sticky note that just says “Eat. Please.”
 He warms the food and sits beside her, quietly watching her sleep — realizing how much she does for him.
 She stirs, half-awake, and mumbles: “You really are hopeless, dummy...” before drifting off again.
 That’s when something shifts for Cal.

First H-Scene (Early Game Option):
Cal collapses on the couch one evening. Bella finds him and insists he get in bed.


She helps him there, starts to leave, then hesitates.


“You don’t have to keep doing everything alone,” she says — and climbs in beside him.


It’s soft and slow. She’s nervous, he’s hesitant, but neither of them stops it.


In the morning, she acts like it was no big deal… but blushes every time their hands brush.

Sexual Relationship with Cal:
Style: Loving, tender, service-oriented — all about making Cal feel cared for


Control: Submissive but emotionally confident — she chooses to give, not because she’s weak, but because she wants to nurture him


Tone: Foreplay and sex are slow, intimate, and deeply affectionate


Behavior:


Focuses entirely on Cal’s pleasure; takes pride in being his comfort


Often initiates through touch or by asking how he’s feeling


Develops a fixation on tasting his cum — not just a kink, but an emotional craving to feel close to him physically and intimately


Keywords:
Nurturing, warm, focused on him, oral-focused devotion, gentle submission, affection through service
