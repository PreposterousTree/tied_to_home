Love Interest #4: Sophia Marx
Age: 18
 Role: Bella and Ryder’s mutual friend, completing the trio
 Personality: Naive, bubbly, overly trusting
 Quirk: Constantly says things like “I’m not good with long things… like equations!” with zero awareness

Traits:
Genuinely wants to do well in school but struggles with focus


Always chipper, asks questions others are too embarrassed to ask


Touchy and physically affectionate with everyone, including Cal


Sees the world through rose-colored glasses — nothing seems threatening to her



Relationship Start:
Sophia approaches Cal shyly, asking if he can help her with math.
 She stumbles over her words and says, “I just need someone older and experienced… to show me how it all works.”
 Cal raises an eyebrow, unsure if she knows what she just implied.
 He agrees to help — and initially, they do just study.
 But the double entendres keep coming, and Cal eventually interprets them as interest.

First H-Scene:
After several study sessions filled with unintentional innuendo, Sophia leans too close while asking about “fractions and positions”


Cal gently tests her reactions — and she responds, wide-eyed, curious


It becomes clear that while Sophia didn’t plan for this, she wants it once it begins


Their intimacy is slow, exploratory, and filled with “Wait… really?” moments:

Expanded Notes: 
Naturally submissive; responds to praise, structure, and control


Excels in scenes with power play, obedience tests, and gentle correction


Dislikes pain, whimpering or resisting when things hurt — which becomes part of how the MC tests limits


Her exploration arc is about trust and surrender, not endurance

Sexual Relationship with Cal:
Style: Natural submissive — gentle, eager, and instinctively obedient


Control: Fully yields to Cal’s authority with open trust


Tone: Sweet, wide-eyed innocence wrapped in deeply devoted submission


Behavior:


Loves being praised, corrected, and instructed


Submits without resistance — not as a game, but because it makes her feel safe and special


Power-Dynamic Roleplay: Leans into obedience games, "training," and deferential positions (kneeling, crawling, etc.)


Pet Play (Mid Game): Responds well to collaring, crawling, commands, and being called things like “pet,” “kitten,” or “bunny”


Watersports Kink:


Introduced in mid to late game through soft exploration


Sophia is curious and accepting, trusting Cal to guide her through new experiences


She comes to associate the act with affection and closeness, reinforcing her desire to belong fully to him


Limits: Not masochistic — flinches at pain or harsh treatment. Her kinks center on devotion, not punishment.
