Traits:
Always finds an excuse to talk to Cal at work


Brings him coffee, little snacks, or sticky notes with hearts drawn on them


Treats every compliment like it’s life-changing praise


Fiercely wants to be seen as an adult even though she acts like an excited puppy



Relationship Start:
One day, Cal thanks her sincerely for always remembering his coffee order
 She practically glows and blurts out, “I just want to make your mornings sweeter, Boss!”
 Later, she corners him by the elevator to ask if he has plans this weekend — and turns beet red after realizing how forward that was
 Cal starts to see that behind the energetic praise is someone who really wants to be taken seriously

First H-Scene:
Happens after a small after-hours event at the office — she tags along to help him clean up


She teases him with, “Do I finally get my reward for being such a good assistant?”


It starts playful and teasing, but turns intense as she clings to the attention and validation


Afterward, she’s adorably clingy and keeps calling him “Boss” even in bed

Tone: Flirty, wild, and borderline hyper — sex feels like a fun competition she’s determined to win


Behavior:


Constantly initiates — in the kitchen, hallway, office break room if she thinks she can get away with it


Playfully begs for attention, but immediately flips into taking what she wants


Loves being praised and teased, but will sass right back — even during sex


Bounces, moans, giggles — she’s loud, lively, and always ready for round two


Climaxes often, but acts like it’s never enough — she’s addicted to the attention and physicality


Her favorite positions involve movement and rhythm — riding, bouncing, face-to-face with playful kisses and panting
