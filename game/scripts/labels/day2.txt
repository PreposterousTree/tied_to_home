"Already?"

"Did I even sleep, or just blink and land in hell again?"

scene bedroom_c_eyes_open_01 with dissolve

"Feels like I just closed my eyes."

"My back feels like I lost a fight with this mattress."

scene bedroom_c_laying_side_01 with dissolve

"The worst part about Mondays isn’t the work. It’s knowing I’ve got five more lined up behind it."

"I should get up. But the bed feels like it has a gravitational pull."

scene bedroom_c_sitting_bed_01 with dissolve

"Still here. Still tired. Still not packed."

"And somehow still pretending this week will be different."

scene bedroom_c_hand_through_hair_01 with dissolve

"One foot in front of the other, I guess."

"Fake it, then repeat."

# Bathroom
scene bathroom_c_shower_wide_01 with fade

"Hot water. Best part of the day."

"It doesn’t fix anything. But it makes pretending easier."

scene bathroom_c_shower_close_01 with dissolve

"…"

"Wish I could rinse off the part of me that keeps staying."

"Wish I could rinse off the part of me that wants to."

# Dining Room

l "Don’t tell me you joined a sunrise cult or something."

scene kitchen_b_cooking_stove_side_01 with dissolve

b "Of course he didnt. I just made breakfast like usual."

b "He probably smelled food and rose from the dead."

scene dining_clb_seated_table_wide_01 with dissolve

mc "Don’t act like this isn’t a miracle."

mc "You’re both witnessing history."

l "You want a miracle? Try cooking next time."

l "Or doing dishes without whining."

scene dining_b_smile_faint_01 with dissolve

b "Be nice. He just woke up."

b "Besides, I like cooking."

scene dining_c_reflect_soft_01 with dissolve

mc "Technically, I’ve been awake since the birds started screaming."

mc "They’ve got a hell of a work ethic."

l "They scream less when you sleep more."

mc "Noted."

l "And they don’t have to go to a job they hate."

mc "Maybe I’ll scream back next time."

scene dining_b_proud_food_table_01 with dissolve

b "Eat up, both of you. I packed lunches too."

l "You’re a menace. And an angel."

b "It's nothing fancy. Just something that won’t kill you."

l "How did I end up raising someone more competent than me?"

b "And try not to look like you hate life until after lunch."

mc "I’ll try."

"Back to the grind."

"Every Monday I wonder if today’s the day I don’t come back."

"Then I remember: bills, food, responsibilities… and Frank."

scene reception_cf_greeting_01 with dissolve

f "There he is! Mr. Monday Morning Regret!"

f "Looking like a man who slept in his worries."

mc "You say that like it’s not your nickname too."

mc "Besides, I’m just trying to match the office aesthetic - dead inside."

scene reception_cf_walk_in_01 with dissolve

f "Difference is, I embrace it. Regret’s just foreplay for beer."

f "Speaking of which, Friday. Drinks. You in?"

mc "We’ll see if I make it that far."

"Frank Lloyd. Man's in his late fifties. Been working together for almost a decade."

"He's loud by default and after years of smoking he's got a voice like a busted speaker. And he's a man with a face made for radio."

"Frank’s a bachelor by choice. At least now. He's been married and divorced 3 times."

"And he's the closest thing I’ve got to a friend in this place."

# Bullpen
scene bullpen_cf_enter_01 with fade

f "So how’s the home life, huh? Girls still pretending you're the man of the house?"

f "Or have they staged a coup yet?"

mc "They don’t pretend. They’re just polite enough not to point out I’m not."

mc "Pretty sure even the TV outranks me."

scene bullpen_cf_desk_stand_01 with dissolve

f "Polite girls? At your place? Can I move in?"

f "I’ll bring charm and zero domestic skills."

mc "No vacancy. And you'd get eaten alive."

mc "Probably by breakfast."

f "Bah, I’d die happy. Probably smothered under a mountain of sass and sarcasm."

mc "Better than paperwork."

mc "But barely."

f "Speak for yourself. These invoices don’t sass me. They just ignore me like my ex-wife."

f "Or my second one. Or the third…"

scene bullpen_c_working_01 with fade

"Frank finally wandered off. Small blessings."

"Time to get some actual work done."

scene bullpen_c_focus_desk_01 with dissolve

"I'm an accountant for a design firm. But it sounds flashier than it is."

"Mostly it’s spreadsheets, reports, and making sure someone’s modern art passion project doesn’t bankrupt the company."

scene bullpen_c_sitting_head_down_01 with dissolve

"Every day feels like the last. Same chair. Same screen. Same countdown to five o’clock."

"Some days I wonder if I chose this job... or just never left it."

"Design sounds exciting. But I’m the guy who tells them no."

"No, you can’t afford that sculpture. No, the LED floor tiles aren’t in budget."

"It’s thankless. But I guess that’s the job."

# Naomi enters

n "Uhm... hey, Cal?"

n "Sorry... are you busy?"

scene bullpen_cn_desk_talk_01 with dissolve

"Naomi Little. She's a graphic designer with a soft voice and softer heart."

"She sees things other people miss. Including me."

scene bullpen_cn_desk_talk_shy_01 with dissolve

n "I was wondering... would you want to eat lunch together today?"

n "If you’re not already meeting someone."

scene bullpen_cn_desk_talk_02 with dissolve

mc "Yeah. That sounds nice."

mc "Thanks for asking."

n "Okay. Um... breakroom?"

n "I grabbed a corner table."

mc "Lead the way."

# Breakroom
scene breakroom_cn_enter_01 with fade

n "I brought extra salad. Hope that’s okay."

n "I kind of over-packed again."

scene breakroom_cn_sit_01 with dissolve

mc "Honestly, if it’s not instant noodles, I’m grateful."

n "You should eat better."

n "You look... tired."

scene breakroom_c_smile_01 with dissolve

mc "You sound like someone I live with."

mc "She says the same thing."

mc "She gave me something to bring. Since your sharing I should too."

scene breakroom_n_smile_01 with dissolve

n "She must care about you."

n "A lot."

scene breakroom_cn_eat_01 with dissolve

"She does. They all do."

"Naomi doesn’t say much. But when she does, it sticks."

"There’s something about how she listens... like it matters."

"Feels strange, being noticed."
