"Wednesday."

"Already?"

scene bedroom_c_eyes_open_01 with dissolve

"Pretty sure I just closed my eyes."

"Why does this bed feel like it’s punishing me for something I can’t remember doing?"

"Maybe today’s the day I finally pack the damn bag."

scene bedroom_c_sitting_bed_01 with dissolve

"Get up. Shower. Breathe. Run."

"Or stall just long enough to do none of the above."

scene bedroom_c_hand_through_hair_01 with dissolve

"One more day."

"Maybe I’m just waiting for the world to make the decision for me."

"Wouldn’t be the first time."

# Entryway – Bathroom Encounter
scene entry_c_rub_eyes_01 with fade

"My eyes feel glued shut."

"Maybe if I rinse my face, I’ll—"

scene entry_cl_bathroom_exit_01 with dissolve

"..."

l "Too late, perv. The show’s already over."

scene entry_cl_reaction_stare_01 with dissolve

mc "Hey. Lilith... "

mc "I wanted to say I’m sorry. About yesterday."

scene entry_cl_reaction_talk_02 with dissolve

mc "I didn’t mean to walk in on you."

mc "I should’ve knocked. I usually do."

scene entry_l_stairs_up_01 with dissolve

mc "Nothing?"

"Not even a glance."

scene entry_c_sigh_01 with dissolve

mc "...She’s that mad, huh?"

mc "...Yeah. That’s fair."

# Bathroom
scene bathroom_c_shower_wide_01 with fade

mc "...She didn’t even look at me."

mc "That’s how mad she is."

mc "Fair. Still stings, though."

scene bathroom_c_shower_close_01 with dissolve

mc "She always walks around like that?"

mc "Like it’s normal?"

mc "Like I’m not supposed to notice?"

scene bathroom_c_shower_lean_01 with dissolve

mc "Not the time, Junior.\n\nNot the time."

mc "I need to get her out of my head before I walk into a wall."

# Entryway – After Shower
scene entry_c_towel_exit_01 with fade

"..."

scene entry_l_stairs_down_01 with dissolve

"She’s already dressed."

"No eye contact. No ‘bye.’"

scene entry_l_exit_01 with dissolve

"Guess breakfast wasn’t on the menu today."

"Not even a sarcastic jab?"

scene entry_c_sigh_01 with dissolve

"Definitely mad."

# Dining Room
scene dining_cb_sit_01 with fade

b "I was thinking of inviting a couple of friends over next week."

mc "You planning something?"

b "Just dinner. Maybe a movie night or something. It's been a while."

mc "You already know where the chaos is gonna come from."

b "That’s the fun part."

scene dining_cb_talk_01 with dissolve

b "Eat your eggs. I didn’t stand over a stove for half an hour to watch you mope."

mc "You really waited?"

b "Of course I did."

mc "Sorry about your mom."

b "What for?"

mc "Just... how she’s been acting. Lately. This morning."

b "She’s always like that."

scene dining_cb_smile_01 with dissolve

b "You’re just noticing more when there’s less towel."

mc "I was trying not to."

b "Try harder."

mc "I swear I knocked."

b "I’m sure Junior did too."

scene dining_cb_giggle_01 with dissolve

mc "You’re worse than she is."

b "And yet you’re still sitting here."

# Entryway
scene entry_cb_lunch_pass_01 with fade

b "Here. And no dropping it this time."

mc "It was one time."

b "Really?"

mc "Okay maybe two."

scene entry_cb_smile_01 with dissolve

mc "Hey, um... thanks. For last night."

scene entry_cb_blush_01 with dissolve

b "It's nothing."

mc "Seriously. It helped.

mc "More than I thought it would."

"Back to it."

"New day. Same fluorescent graveyard."

scene reception_cf_greeting_01 with dissolve

f "You look like a man who lost a fight with a towel."

scene reception_cf_talk_01 with dissolve

f "And the towel won."

mc "You're not wrong."

f "Steam injury? Sudden case of shame?"

mc "Emotional damage. Minor bruising. No witnesses."

f "That’s the best kind."

scene reception_cf_walk_in_01 with dissolve

mc "You need help."

f "I need a drink."

f "Or a woman who cooks naked. But the drink's more realistic."

mc "Please don’t put those images in my head before payroll meetings."

f "Don’t blame me. I’m just trying to get you through the week."

# Bullpen
scene bullpen_c_enter_01 with fade

"Focus."

"Numbers. Deadlines. Totally not thinking about towels or silence or Bella saying 'dummy.'"

scene bullpen_c_desk_typing_01 with dissolve

"She didn’t even glance at me."

"Didn’t even pause."

scene bullpen_c_desk_sigh_02 with dissolve

"I deserve that."

"But it still sucks."

scene bullpen_c_desk_sigh_01 with dissolve

"And what was with Bella this morning?"

"Actually she's been blushing a lot lately?

"What does that mean?"

scene bullpen_c_desk_standing_01 with dissolve

"Maybe some food will help me get some actual work done."

# Breakroom
scene breakroom_c_enter_01 with fade

"Peace. Finally."

"No Frank. No emails. Just me and this sandwich I probably don’t deserve."

scene breakroom_c_sit_01 with dissolve

"She even cut the crusts."

"That girl’s gonna make someone very happy one day."

scene breakroom_c_table_think_01 with dissolve

"Frank’s stupid towel line keeps bouncing around my skull."

"And of course it makes me picture Lilith from this morning."

scene breakroom_c_table_lean_01 with dissolve

"Ugh..."

"Maybe it wasn’t the towel's fault."

"Maybe it’s mine."

"The way I freeze up. The way I avoid conflict."

scene breakroom_c_table_stare_01 with dissolve

"Bella's massage last night was really relaxful."

"She keeps trying to help me. And I can only seem to accept it begrudginly."

scene breakroom_c_sit_01 with dissolve

"Hell, even Frank seems to try and help."

"In his own demented way."

scene breakroom_c_sit_02 with dissolve

"Maybe it’s time I stop pretending I don’t need anyone."

"Maybe just for once, I can accept the offered hand."

"Maybe just for once, I can lean on someone else for support."

# Bullpen – Return to Desk
scene bullpen_c_return_01 with fade

"Back to it."

scene bullpen_c_desk_note_02 with dissolve

"...Another doodle?"

"A cartoon me sitting at my desk day dreaming."

scene bullpen_c_working_01 with dissolve

"I guess they're not wrong."

"Whoever they are."

scene bullpen_c_desk_smile_01 with dissolve

mc "Whoever’s doing this… it’s working."

mc "Thanks. I guess."

mc "You know those things are gonna kill you, right?"

l "Tsk."

l "So will life. At least this one's polite enough to do it slow."

scene porch_cl_smoking_01 with dissolve

mc "Still a hell of a trade. Ten minutes of peace for ten years off the end."

l "You planning to live forever?"

scene porch_cl_smoking_02 with dissolve

mc "I was hoping to make it through the week."

l "Then maybe stop creeping around and let me enjoy one damn cigarette."

mc "You're right. Sorry."

scene porch_cl_smoking_01 with dissolve

l "So how was work?"

mc "Shitty. But do you really care?"

scene porch_cl_smoking_02 with dissolve

l "No, but it's kinda awkward with you just standing there."

mc "Haha. Sorry about that."

mc "I can leave if you want."

scene porch_cl_smoking_01 with dissolve

l "... It's a free country."

l "Besides I'm done."

scene porch_cl_smoking_03 with dissolve

mc "I just... worry about you, Lily."

scene porch_cl_blush_01 with dissolve

# Dining Room
scene dining_cl_table_01 with fade

mc "This smells amazing. Did you make it, Bella?"

scene dining_cb_plate_pass_02 with dissolve

b "Yeah. Mom almost lit the kitchen on fire again, so I took over."

scene dining_clb_table_01 with dissolve

l "You're welcome, by the way. For not burning the house down."

mc "Truly heroic."

scene dining_cb_talk_01 with dissolve

mc "You always cook this well under pressure?"

b "Only when the alternative is fire damage."

scene dining_clb_talk_01 with dissolve

l "Or emotional damage."

b "Be nice, Mom."

l "Tsk."

scene dining_clb_talk_02 with dissolve

mc "What kind of seasoning is this? Feels different."

l "It's salt. You’d know if you ever cooked anything that didn’t come in a microwaveable tray."

b "Mom, stop."

scene dining_clb_talk_03 with dissolve

l "I’m just saying, the man wouldn’t survive a week alone."

mc "I’m sitting right here, you know."

l "Sadly, I do."

scene dining_b_fork_01 with dissolve

b "Next one to speak is washing dishes. Alone."

scene dining_clb_eat_dinner_01 with dissolve

"..."

"... I miss when silence was the awkward part."

# Bedroom

"She punched me."

"Again."

"But she blushed first."

scene bedroom_c_eyes_open_01 with dissolve

"And for just a second… she didn’t look angry."

"She looked scared."

scene bedroom_ceiling_02 with dissolve

"Like I’d gotten too close."

"Like I saw something I wasn’t supposed to."

scene bedroom_c_arm_over_eyes_01 with dissolve

"She didn’t hate it."

"That’s the part I can’t stop thinking about."

"And probably the part she’ll never admit."
